# ➕ Creating a New Account Plan

This guide walks you through creating an account plan from scratch. You can also create plans from templates—see [Templates](templates.md).

---

## Step 1: Start a New Plan

1. Go to **Account Planning** in the sidebar.
2. Click **New Account**.
3. You will see the new account form.

---

## Step 2: Fill In Basic Information

### Subject

- Enter a **Subject** (e.g., "Q1 2025 - Acme Corp").
- This is the main title of the plan.

### Period

- Select the **Period** (date) for the plan.
- This is typically the month or quarter the plan covers.

### Client (Required)

- Select the **Client** from the dropdown.
- The client's address will load automatically below.
- This field is required.

## Step 3: Section A – Background

In this section you enter:

- **Product** – Main product or service
- **Sale channel online** – Online sales channels
- **Sale channel offline** – Offline sales channels
- **Vision** – Client's vision (text area)
- **Mission** – Client's mission (text area)
- **Custom fields** – Any custom fields you configured for Account Planning

## Step 4: Section B – Financial

This is a **spreadsheet-style table** (Handsontable) where you enter:

- **Year** – Fiscal year
- **Revenue** – Revenue amount
- **Sales spent** – Sales expenditure
- **Traffic** – Traffic metrics
- **Loss** – Loss amount

You can add multiple rows. Enter data directly in the cells.

## Step 5: Section C – Marketing Activities

Another **spreadsheet-style table** for:

- **Item** – Marketing activity name
- **Reference** – Reference or notes

Add as many rows as needed.

---

## Step 6: Save the Plan

1. Click **Submit** at the bottom.
2. The plan will be created and you will be redirected to the plan view.
3. You can now fill in the other tabs: Team Information, Service Ability Offering, Planning, etc.

---

## Creating from a Template

To save time:

1. Go to **Account Planning** → **Templates**.
2. Create a template with your standard structure.
3. When creating a new plan, use **Create from Template** and select the template.
4. The plan will be pre-filled; adjust as needed and save.

See [Templates](templates.md) for details.

## Default Status

New plans use the **Default status** set in **Settings** (Draft, In Progress, or Review). You can change this per plan later in the Planning tab.
