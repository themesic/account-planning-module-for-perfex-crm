## What Clients See

### Account Planning Menu

- Clients see **Account Planning** in their client portal sidebar.
- Clicking it opens a list of their account plans.

### Plans List

The list shows:

- **ID** – Plan number
- **Subject** – Plan title
- **Plan Status** – Draft, In Progress, Review, Completed, Archived
- **Date** – Plan period

Only plans for **their** client account are visible.

## Viewing a Plan

When a client clicks **View** on a plan:

- They see the plan in **read-only** mode.
- They can browse tabs (Due Diligence, Team Information, Planning, etc.).
- They **cannot** edit anything.

---

## Request Update

Clients can request that staff update the plan:

1. While viewing a plan, they click **Request update** (or similar).
2. A request is sent to staff.
3. Staff see an alert on the plan: "Client requested plan update – X pending request(s)."
4. Staff can **Mark as handled** when the update is done.

## Mobile-Friendly

The client portal views are designed to work on mobile devices:

- Tables use responsive layout.
- Buttons and links are touch-friendly.
- Content adapts to smaller screens.

## Permissions
